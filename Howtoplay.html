			<p id="helpbrief"> Welcome to the world's fastest sense of humour game!
			If this is your first time playing this game, welcome! After you read this tutorial, click
			the button below that says "Topics" to start picking what jokes you'll be answering! Enjoy :)
			<br> </br>
			In this game a joke will flash on screen but with (shock and horror) one word missing from the punchline!
			Not to worry though, because all you need to do is type in said missing word, using the handy textboxes that we'll provide!
			Aren't we generous?
			<br> </br>
			You're probably thinking "That sounds too easy, can't we liven things up a little?". Well of course! Depending on what difficulty
			level you select before the game begins, you'll have to finish a different number of jokes, against the clock. Here's what each difficulty
			level entails:
